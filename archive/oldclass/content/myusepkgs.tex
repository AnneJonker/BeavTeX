% If you are doing something fancy and need some custom
% packages, put them in here.  Make sure that the packages
% are available on your system -- run "kpsepath tex" to 
% check TeX's path, and as a last resort, put them all in
% the "root" directory of this distribution, that is, right
% next to the makefile and thesis.tex files.

% \usepackage{anysize} % allows margin specification
\usepackage{cite}    % Allows linebreaks in citations
