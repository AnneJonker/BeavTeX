%%  (comment out, or in, the lists you will need)
\tableofcontents
\listoffigures
\listoftables  % this will overlap with list of algorithms if there
% are no tables, I don't know why.
%\listofappendixfigures
%\listofappendixtables
%\listof{appendixtable}{List Of Appendix Tables}
%\listofalgorithms
