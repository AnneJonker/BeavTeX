Not much to say.  Everything you really need to change is in 
the subdirectory called "content/".  Ideally you shouldn't have 
to change anything in this top-level directory, but I haven't
had time to clean stuff up sufficiently to back up that claim.
You may still have to mess with the files here.  Good luck.

Use it, clean it up, make it a better template than you started 
with, and pass it on.  Maybe some day this will not be so 
painful.
